StudentDocs is a macOS app for personal student documentation.

## Data we collect
We **do not collect, store, or transmit** personal data to our servers. The app has **no account system**.

Your documents and settings remain on your device unless you choose to export or share them.

## Crash/diagnostics
If you opt in to Apple’s crash/diagnostics sharing on macOS, Apple may provide us with **aggregated crash reports** via App Store Connect. These reports do not include personal information.

## Permissions & files
StudentDocs reads/writes files only in locations you choose (e.g., when you save or open a document).  
If you enable iCloud Drive for your own files, syncing is handled by Apple; we do not run any servers.

## Third‑party services
None.

## Changes
We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected on this page with a new effective date.
